     This course is arguably the best in the country. Its strength is its adaptability to the changing industry requirements. A student gets knowledge of the latest technologies, in addition to ample industry exposure. The students are given a choice of subject from the 6th semester itself in the form of electives. The students have ample practical knowledge owing to the mini projects taken up in their 5th, 6th and 7th semesters. Apart from this, the students are required to submit an industrial project in their 8th semester. The course includes both theory and lab sessions. The curriculum emphasizes importance of applied knowledge, and promotes state-of-the-art teaching and learning.
